# check_stale_nfs.sh

A small monitoring plugin to check whether nfs mounts
on the systems are "stale" (probably the network connection
to the server vanished or something similar).

Execution is just:
```
/check_stale_nfs.sh
```

This plugin does not have a lot of features, but should be helpful
in some situations.
